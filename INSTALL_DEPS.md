# Install Dependencies

To complete the performance optimizations, please run:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install `react-fast-marquee` which provides smooth, hardware-accelerated marquee animations for the marketplace and tools sliders.

## Changes Made:

1. **Optimized Hero Section** - Removed heavy Framer Motion animations
2. **Added react-fast-marquee** - Ultra-smooth GPU-accelerated sliders
3. **CSS-based animations** - Lightweight, performant scroll animations
4. **Hardware acceleration** - Applied globally for smoother rendering

After running `npm install`, restart the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The site should now be much smoother, especially on mobile devices!
